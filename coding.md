## Learning to code

Coding is fundamentally a creative activity.  The most exciting thing about
writing code is that you can create something from nothing.

Coding is also a skill, or rather a collection of skills, involving:

* logical thinking: understanding the logical flow of ideas
* algorithmic thinking:  understanding how to arrange individual steps in order
    to do accomplish a task
* mathematical thinking: understanding number systems (e.g. decimal vs.
    binary), coordinate systems and geometry (e.g. computer graphics)
* managing complexity: code can become complicated very quickly, so keeping
    things organized is essential

Skill in coding is just like any other skill: if you practice, your abilities
will improve.  There is no magic formula, just time and effort.  


## Getting stuck

At some point, you will get stuck on something (i.e. your program is not doing
what you want it to do, and you're not sure what's wrong).  Don't worry!
First, take a deep breath and look at your code again to look for errors.  Pay
attention to the error messages.  Ask your classmates.  Search the internet to
see if someone else has had the same problem.  If you still can't find a
solution, take a break.  You will find a solution -- sometimes it just takes a
little more time and effort than you anticipated.
